# Simple Annotate

A simple way to annotate interactive prototypes. *Work in progress.*

## Install with [Bower](http://bower.io)
`bower install simple-annotate --save`

## Use in your prototype
Just include the JS and CSS (make sure the paths to the images are correct or place the simple-annotate images in you public `/images/` directory) and create a div with the class `annotation` with annotations in it. An example of this can be seen in [wireframework.com](http://www.wireframework.com) or the example directory in this repository (click the question mark at the bottom left).
